# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Project

Welcome to the **Airbnb Clone Project** — a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb. This project simulates a real-world, scalable booking platform and includes both **frontend** and **backend** development tracks. Users can browse listings, book properties, make payments, and leave reviews, while hosts can manage their properties and bookings.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This full-stack project replicates Airbnb's core features, covering:

- A responsive and intuitive **frontend interface**
- A secure and robust **backend API**
- Scalable database design and data flow
- Deployment through modern DevOps practices

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Frontend Goals

- Build a clean, responsive UI using reusable components
- Integrate frontend with backend APIs
- Follow accessibility and mobile-first design principles

### Backend Goals

- Handle user authentication, bookings, payments, and reviews
- Document and secure RESTful & GraphQL APIs
- Deploy using Docker and CI/CD pipelines

## 🗃️ Database Design

### Entities and Fields

- Users: id, email, username, password, profile_image
- Properties: id, title, location, price, host_id
- Bookings: id, user_id, property_id, checkin, checkout
- Reviews: id, property_id, user_id, rating, comment
- Payments: id, booking_id, amount, payment_status

### Entity Relationships

- A user can list multiple properties
- A user can book multiple properties
- A property can have many bookings and reviews
- Each booking has one payment

## 🔄 Feature Breakdown

| Feature             | Description                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| User Authentication | Register, log in, manage profiles securely  |
| Property Listings   | Add, edit, delete, and view properties      |
| Search and Filters  | Location, price range, rating filters       |
| Booking System      | Select dates, confirm availability, reserve |
| Payment Gateway     | Process and confirm secure transactions     |
| Reviews and Ratings | Users can leave reviews and see feedback    |

## 🔐 API Security

### Key Measures

- Authentication: Token-based login (e.g., JWT)
- Authorization: Role-based route access
- Rate Limiting: Prevent endpoint abuse
- Input Validation: Block malicious inputs (SQL/XSS)
- HTTPS Only: Encrypt user data during transfer

### Why Security Matters

- Protects sensitive data like passwords and payments
- Prevents unauthorized property or booking manipulation
- Ensures trusted platform interaction

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### What Is CI/CD?

CI/CD is the automation of building, testing, and deploying your code with every change—improving consistency and reducing manual errors.

### Tools Used:

- GitHub Actions – Auto-build/test on push or PR
- Docker – Containerized apps for any environment
- Heroku/Vercel – Deployment targets (or custom VPS)

### Pipeline Tasks:

- Run unit and integration tests
- Lint code for style consistency
- Deploy apps automatically upon merge
